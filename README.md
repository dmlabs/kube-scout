# kube-scout
A tool to visualize and manage vulnerabilities in Docker Images, Kubernetes Clusters and Kubernetes Cluster Nodes.
Tools for scanning like aquasecurity/kube-hunter or aquasecurity/trivy are already available and also offer json as output.
The idea is to save that json output in a MongoDB, visualize it with a custom web application and add information like comments.

This project is new, more and detailed information will follow in the future.
